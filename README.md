# Arduino Radiation Watch library

An Arduino library to interface with the [Radiation Watch Pocket Geiger counter](http://www.radiation-watch.co.uk/) (Type 5).

![](/misc/type5.jpg?raw=true "Radiation Watch Type 5 Pocket Geiger counter")

The library monitors the Pocket Geiger through interrupts, processes the hourly [Sievert dose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sievert) and allows to get back the data using a simple interface. It comes with examples to print data to Serial, log it on a SD card or through internet, giving you some ideas of what to do with it.

## Getting started

### Install the library

Download [the library as a zip](https://github.com/MonsieurV/RadiationWatch/archive/master.zip), extract it and put it in your Arduino `libraries` folder. (see [instructions](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries))

### Wire your Pocket Geiger board to your Arduino

First connect your Pochet Geiger Type 5 board to your Arduino. By default, the binding used is as follow:

| Pocket Geiger pin | Arduino pin | Standing for |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| `+V` | `5V` | Alimentation pin (DC 3V~9V) |
| `GND` | `GND` | Ground pin |
| `SIG` | `2` | Radiation-detection pulse pin |
| `NS` | `3` | Noise-detection pulse pin |

You can change the pins used by the library at its initialization. Remember to use pins that [enable external interrupts](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/AttachInterrupt).

```
/*
signPin is the radiation pulse pin, which must match the signIrq number.
noisePin is the noise pulse pin, which must match the noiseIrq number.
*/
RadiationWatch radiationWatch(signPin, noisePin, signIrq, noiseIrq);
```

### Launch the Serial printer example

Go to your Arduino examples and launch the `RadiationWatch` -> `SimpleSerialPrinter` sketch. It outputs the current emission level at each  [Gamma ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray) that hits the Pocket Geiger counter.

Your done! Enjoy your *hopefully* low exposure to Gamma radiation.
